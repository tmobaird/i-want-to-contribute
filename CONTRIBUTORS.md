# Contributors Map

Through code, the internet, and Github, we are gifted the ability to contribute and work together from all over the world :earth_americas:. We should embrace this great opportunity with open arms. The point of this doc is to list all of the contributors for this project and the locations they represent. It may just be me [Thomas Baird], but I believe this could be a really cool concept to keep track of!

If you make a contribution to this project, feel free to add your name to this list. Also if you do not see your location listed, feel free to add that as well.
