### What is it?
A React app that assists with finding open source projects that are open for contributions.

### Why was it created?

This project was created to help facilitate my learning of modern front end JavaScript frameworks, more specifically, ReactJS and some of the really neat libraries that take React development to the next level.

On top of that... Contributing to open source projects is intimidating, and can be hard. But it shouldn't be. This project strives to assist developers to find and contribute to open source projects on Github.

### create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

If you'd like to find some information about how to perform common tasks for this app
using create-react-app's recipes, check out [this doc]().
You can also find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

If you're looking to start contributing, it's probably best to first familiarize yourself with the workflow for create-react-app applications. It's not difficult at all, but it will help you understand how to set up your development environment for this project.
